<h3 align="center">Victor Nisem Passionate Computer Science Student | AI Enthusiast | Problem Solver I am a motivated and enthusiastic computer science student currently pursuing my studies at Hurghada Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence. With a strong interest in technology and artificial intelligence, I am driven to explore new frontiers in the world of programming and machine learning. My skills encompass a wide range of areas, including proficiency in Python, C++, data structures, algorithms, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL), and a problem-solving mindset. I take on challenges with attention to detail and a commitment to finding innovative solutions. One of my notable achievements includes the development of an Encryption & Decryption System. Utilizing the RSA algorithm in C++, I ensured robust security for user messages and images, showcasing my dedication to creating secure and reliable systems. Additionally, I created a user-friendly Website for Blood Bank using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. This platform streamlined blood donation management by enabling easy navigation, requesting blood samples, and updating inventory efficiently. Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively engage in competitions and volunteering activities. As a contestant in the ECPC for two years, I honed my problem-solving skills and demonstrated my technical abilities. I have also taken on organizational roles in events such as ICool Challenge, Iron Man Challenge, and NASA Space Apps Sohag, reflecting my leadership and commitment to contributing to the tech community. As I continue my journey in computer science, I am eager to seize new opportunities and gain practical experiences that will further enrich my skill set. My goal is to make a positive impact in the fields of computer science and AI, driving advancements that benefit society. With a thirst for knowledge and a passion for innovation, I maintain an active presence on GitHub, showcasing my diverse projects and contributions. I look forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals and exploring exciting possibilities in the ever-evolving realm of technology. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of working together! Contact Information ðŸ“§ Email: victornisem01@gmail.com ðŸ”— LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/victor-nisem</h3>
